## Installation Guide
### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Conda**

### 2Ô∏è. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bebopkenny/Snake-AI-Game.git
cd Snake-AI-Game
```

### 3Ô∏è. Create a Conda Environment
```bash
conda create -n pygame_env python=3.7
conda activate pygame_env
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
### To Play the Game:
```bash
python game.py
```

### To Train the AI:
```bash
python agent.py
```

---

## How It Works
The AI agent is trained using **Q-Learning**, a type of reinforcement learning where the agent learns to maximize rewards by taking specific actions.

### AI Logic:
- **State Representation:** The agent observes the game state, including the position of the snake's head, food location, and possible collisions.
- **Action Space:** The agent can move in three directions: straight, left, or right.
- **Reward System:**
  - Positive reward (+10) for eating food.
  - Negative reward (-10) for hitting a wall or itself.
  
### Deep Neural Network:
The agent uses a **Linear Neural Network** built with PyTorch to predict the best possible action based on the current state.

## Graphical Plot
A **real-time graph** is displayed during training to visualize the agent's progress:
- **Number of Games vs. Score**
- **Mean Score over Time**

The graph is generated using **Matplotlib**.
